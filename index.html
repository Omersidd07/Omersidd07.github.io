    <p class="info-icon">During previous times, countries from the Americas and the European regions would exploit African countries for their resources and colonize them. As a result of this, underdevelopment in these countries have been adverse.</p>
    <p class="info-icon">Although countries in the African region grew in population just as other countries did, their growth in medicine, GDP, and other facets was stunted.</p>
    <p class="info-icon">In different aspects such as medicine and financial standing, countries in the African regions are far behind the countries that once exploited them for resources.</p>
    <p class="info-icon">This slideshow shows the difference in African countries and countries of other regions in terms of infant mortality rate, as well as other data findings that will give better insight into the gap between the regions.</p>
